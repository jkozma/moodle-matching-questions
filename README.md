moodle-matching-questions
=========================

Generate Moodle Gift formatted matching questions from a list of definitions.

This is a stand-alone javascript form into which you paste a list of terms with definitions to produce matching questions formatted for import into Moodle. Help documentation is integrated in the form. An IE version is included with some features disabled that do not work in versions of IE prior to IE 11.

The VocabularySampleInput.txt file includes sample data that can be copied and pasted as input, and illustrates the use of feedback fields.
